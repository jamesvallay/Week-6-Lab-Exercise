# Week-6-Lab-Exercise
Lab exercise for week 6 with Oscar

Purpose of the program: Our program takes in a name and a integer. It squares the integer, and returns a statement including the user's name and how the program will keep the square of the person's favorite number a secret.


Code of conduct: We used the Covenant Code of Conduct because of how widely used and accepted it is. It reaches far since it has been translated into over 30 languages and has already been adopted into over 40,000 open source projects. We want our project to be used for positive purposes, and be a place where people can feel safe around one another. The Covenant Code of Conduct does this by clearly defining acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

License: The license is from IBM, which a trusted source. It is very clearly defined and gets it's point across relatively efficiently.
